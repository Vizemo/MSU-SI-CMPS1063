Program 5: Program will process big numbers.

Initialize S1
The length of S1 is 14
S1 = 00000987654321
Swap S1 and S2
S2 = 00000987654321
Reset S2 to 987654321
S2 = 987654321
Let S1 be the 10's complement of S2
S1 = 123456789
Sum of S1 and S2 is 1111111110
Getting ready to destruct S1 and S2.
Thank you for using the SuperCard Program. 

If your program does not crash - destructor worked.

Goodbye.
