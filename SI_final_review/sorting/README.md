| | **Selection Sort** | **Insertion Sort** |
| - | - | - |
| **Time Complexity (Best)** | O(n^2) (no early exit possible) | O(n) (already sorted) |
| **Time Complexity (Worst)** | O(n^2) | O(n^2) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1) | O(1) |
| **Stable?** | No (if swaps break order) | Yes |
| **Adaptive?** | No | Yes (faster on nearly sorted data)|
